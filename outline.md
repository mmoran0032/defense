Introduction
------------

-   Uses of recoil mass separation
    -   Nuclear astrophysics
    -   General study, important reaction chains/cycles
    -   Minimum astro context for why
-   Radiative capture
    -   Important reactions, kinematics
    -   Zero-degree capture

Commissioning the separator
---------------------------

-   St. George
    -   Magnets, Wien filter, target, detector, diagnostics
-   Angular and energy acceptance
    -   Energy change from central beam, deflector chamber
-   Joint acceptance
    -   Degrader foil
-   Considerations for transport matrix
    -   Why the acceptances are important

27Al(p,a)24Mg reaction
----------------------

-   Why?
    -   Well-understood test reaction, possibility of looking at different reactions, test angular and energy at the same time, requires different tune
-   What it helps with
-   Results
    -   Angular acceptance, uncertainty decomposition

Future direction
----------------

-   What do I suggest for next parts? (lessons learned)
-   Update on work since experiment
-   Plans for replication using full STG setup
